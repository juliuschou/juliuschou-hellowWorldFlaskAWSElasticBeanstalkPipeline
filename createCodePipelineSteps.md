Could you show the details step to create a aws code pipeline connect to an existing aws code build? The steps should include: 1. create a S3 bucket 2. create a Serice role for codepipeline 3. create a endpont for codepipeline connecting to S3 created above 4. create the pipeline.

Certainly! Below are the detailed steps to create an AWS CodePipeline that's connected to an existing AWS CodeBuild project:

### 1\. Create an S3 Bucket

1.  Open the Amazon S3 Console: Navigate to the [S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2.  Create Bucket: Click on the "Create bucket" button.
3.  Bucket Configuration:
    -   Name and region: Enter a unique bucket name and select the appropriate region.
    -   Configure options: You can leave the default settings unless you have specific requirements.
    -   Set permissions: Ensure that Block Public Access settings are enabled for security purposes.
    -   Review: Review your settings and click on the "Create bucket" button.

### 2\. Create a Service Role for CodePipeline

1.  Open the IAM Console: Navigate to the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2.  Roles: On the left navigation pane, click on "Roles" and then click "Create role".
3.  Select AWS Service Role:
    -   Choose "CodePipeline" as the AWS service.
    -   Click "Next: Permissions".
4.  Attach Permissions Policies:
    -   Search for and attach the `AWSCodePipelineFullAccess` policy.
    -   Also, since we're using S3, add `AmazonS3FullAccess`. (However, in a production scenario, you'd want to use more fine-grained permissions.)
    -   Click "Next: Tags".
5.  Add Tags: Optionally add tags, and then click "Next: Review".
6.  Review:
    -   Name the role (e.g., `CodePipelineServiceRole`).
    -   Review the role and click "Create role".

### 3\. Create an Endpoint for CodePipeline Connecting to S3

If you're referring to using an S3 bucket as the source of your CodePipeline, then during the pipeline creation step you can select S3 as the source provider. However, if you're referring to creating a VPC endpoint to connect your VPC resources to S3 without traversing the public internet:

1.  Open the VPC Dashboard: Navigate to the [VPC Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).
2.  Endpoints: In the left navigation pane, click on "Endpoints" then click "Create Endpoint".
3.  Service Category: Ensure "AWS services" is selected.
4.  Service Name: Choose `com.amazonaws.<region>.s3`.
5.  VPC: Select the VPC you want the endpoint in.
6.  Configure Route Tables: Choose the route tables that should be associated.
7.  Review and Create: Click "Create Endpoint".

### 4\. Create the Pipeline

1.  Open the CodePipeline Console: Navigate to the [CodePipeline Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/).
2.  Start Pipeline Creation:
    -   Click "Create Pipeline".
3.  Step 1: Name:
    -   Name your pipeline.
    -   Choose the service role you created earlier.
    -   Click "Next".
4.  Step 2: Source Stage:
    -   For "Source provider", choose "Amazon S3".
    -   Specify the bucket and the object key for your source artifact in the bucket.
    -   Click "Next".
5.  Step 3: Build Stage:
    -   For "Build provider", choose "AWS CodeBuild".
    -   For "Region", choose the region where your CodeBuild project resides.
    -   For "Project name", choose your existing CodeBuild project.
    -   Click "Next".
6.  Step 4: Deploy Stage (this can vary based on where you want to deploy, e.g., ECS, Lambda, etc.):
    -   Choose your deployment provider and configure as necessary.
    -   Click "Next".
7.  Step 5: Review:
    -   Review all your settings.
    -   Click "Create Pipeline".

Your pipeline will then be created and should automatically run using the source code/artifact from the specified S3 bucket and then pass that to your existing CodeBuild project.
